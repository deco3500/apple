			<h2 class="commentName">Trump did something</h2><br>
			<p class="commentURL">http://www.cnn.com/</p><br>
			<p class="comment">I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Apache” and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.</p>

			<p class="comment">I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.</p>

			<p class="comment">Why are you all picking on Hillary? She clearly has health issues, would you mock your sick Grandma for doing something like this? It's not like it will make her any less capable of being a great President, she's clearly still able to function and can easily receive the best medical care in the world once she's President. Why the fuck would you mock a sick person like this? This shit makes me so angry that my mom came into my room to give me a diazepam pen and I literally screamed at her and hit the pen out of her hands. She started yelling and screeeming me and went go down took her good, wow explode why mock hlry? don't mck nt gd i cant fukciang blier ht chld hwy jolau jdl hlrry presssssssssssssssssssss asdd lac 1911991 pls cal ths is os fckd nsfsdfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff</p>

			<h2 class="commentName">Obama did something</h2><br>
			<p class="commentURL">http://www.cnn.com/</p><br>
			<p class="comment">Did you say something offensive to my lady? Did you say something that I find inappropriate? Yes she is my lady, no we are not dating, but I consider her mine. Not as property perhaps, but as equals. I am a knight, good sir. I fight for the values of women online. I do also own 5 sets of platemail, 2 sets of chainmail, and 15 claymore swords, also 2 battleaxes, mostly for LARPing but I also have some real shit. I will cut you the fuck up. I'm gonna come to your house. I will fight you with my bare fists, probably covered in chainmail because that would give me a little bit of an advantage. I will have my brother Steven, who I share a bedroom with in my mother's apartment, I will have my brother Steven polish my armor after he's done with his next round of Call of Duty and I will take you OUT. I WILL TAKE YOU THE FUCK OUT. I will make sure that you will never speak such harmful, awful, inappropriate things to my lady again. If you say one more fucking word on the Internet, I'm going to show you what a knight can do. I will be able to backtrace your IP using my hacker skills. One time, I hacked my mom's boyfriend's Facebook page and said "lol i am a faggot" and NOW PEOPLE THINK HE'S GAY, and his mother has disowned him I think. My mom and him are still dating, BUT, I think it damaged his credibility a lot. He once left his laptop on, that means I'm a hacker now! I have so many powers you can't imagine. I...have a 178 IQ. I...did an IQ test on Facebook and it said this was a very, very high number. I know that I'm smarter than you, more clever-er than you, more smarter-est than you can ever imagine or believe. I am a knight of many principles. I'm very, VERY strong and very, VERY handsome. YOUUUUUU can't stop me. YOUUUUUU can't take back what you've done. All you can do is apologize and beg, beg for your life. This, and only this, will please me</p>

			<p class="comment">Anyway, like I was sayin’, shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. There’s shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There’s pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That, that’s about it.</p>
