## Introduction
As news sources have moved to the web, algorithms are playing an increasingly critical role in delivering news to consumers. Be it video, articles, or shorter posts, algorithms are filtering the type of news on a per person basis in an attempt to increase click through rates. The main result is an increase in news that aligns to a person's pre-existing views. In terms of politics, someone who historically views left leaning news will be continually delivered similar content as a result of modern algorithms.

Often users have no knowledge that this is occurring, and rarely have the ability to alter this behaviour, to the frustration of some [(Pariser, 2011)](https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles). As a user, you are effectively ‘trapped’ by the filter bubble. As this continues, there is a heightened lack of diversity in news sources, with ‘clickbait’ articles becoming the norm. Again, this is largely due to a push towards greater click through rates.

This is where Bubbler aims to make a difference. In an attempt to re-stabilise political bias in news, Bubbler will sort articles based on their political leaning, allowing users to once again make a conscious decision as to the type of news they consume. These users will largely comprise of people of high school age and older, with varying levels of interests in politics.

## Concept

## Team
|Name | Student Number | Course Code | Role |
--- | --- | --- | ---
Chris Wilkinson | 43942004 | BInfTech/BBusMan | Concept Definition
Jesse Head | 43239151 | BInfTech | Head of UX
Edward Liao | 43555299	| BInfTech | Communication and Team Management

Meetings are scheduled at the following times:

- Monday 2pm 
- Wednesday 2pm
- Friday 1pm (when possible)

Major tasks will be assigned during the meetings with minor tasks being assigned and mentioned between the meetings. Decision making processes will occur here as well as on Slack. Since workshops are on Fridays, the necessity of a team meeting later in the afternoon will be determined in the workshop. 

In the event of poor performance and/or lack of communication, team members will make this situation aware to other members of the group such that the slacking team member is given a warning. Such an event will be documented in the Collaboration and Communication Warnings Log (see Examples below) as documentation for future purposes. Upon the 3rd proverbial strike, supervisors will be notified regarding the event with proof from the Warnings Log. 

Conflicts will be resolved through a voting process. Since there are three members in the team, there will always be a majority. If, in some case, the minority feels particularly strong about a certain situation, external opinions and insight will be acknowledged. 
## Communications
Social platforms/software to be used: 

- Google Docs and Drive for file sharing and collaboration
- Slack for communication
- Trello for task management
- Google Calendar for scheduling
- Github for version management

These platforms have been chosen out of familiarity and consequently the fluency in which the team members use the software and platforms. As a result, less time will be spent learning the interface of a certain program/platform. When a new platform is introduced to the group, there will be a priority placed on learning the interfaces and basics of the platform so that optimal use of the platform is achieved. 

The aforementioned meetings will be set in libraries around the university but for the sake of consistency and convenience, they will take place at the Social Sciences and Humanities library by default. 

Where possible, best practices will be followed for file naming conventions. This includes:

- Clear and concise file names
- Not using spaces or other characters (more specifically ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * (  ) `; : ’ ” [ ] { } , 
- Instead use camel case (“fileName”) or underscores (“file_name”)
- Proper sequential numbering. v0001, v0002, v0003, etc. will ensure that sorting is accurate. To distinguish between Drafts and final 
	- Drafts will be signified as such: v0-01, v0-02
	- Final copies: v1-01, v1-02
- Date and time stamps (when used) will follow a DDMMYY (or DDMMYYYY) and HOUR:MINUTES:SECONDS
	- fileName_12-09-16.docx
	- fileName_12-09-2016.docx
