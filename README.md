# Bubbler

## Introduction
As news sources have moved to the web, algorithms are playing an increasingly critical role in delivering news to consumers. Be it video, articles, or shorter posts, algorithms are filtering the type of news on a per person basis in an attempt to increase click through rates. The main result is an increase in news that aligns to a person's pre-existing views. In terms of politics, someone who historically views left leaning news will be continually delivered similar content as a result of modern algorithms.

Often users have no knowledge that this is occurring, and rarely have the ability to alter this behaviour, to the frustration of some [(Pariser, 2011)](https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles). As a user, you are effectively ‘trapped’ by the filter bubble. As this continues, there is a heightened lack of diversity in news sources, with ‘clickbait’ articles becoming the norm. Again, this is largely due to a push towards greater click through rates.

This is where Bubbler aims to make a difference. In an attempt to re-stabilise political bias in news, Bubbler will sort articles based on their political leaning, allowing users to once again make a conscious decision as to the type of news they consume. These users will largely comprise of people of high school age and older, with varying levels of interests in politics.

## Concept
The application is for anyone who appreciates a site that presents a variety of viewpoints, and brings about healthy discussion. The aim of the project is to aggregate news article links to offer an decentralised, unfiltered, variety of news sources. The site is free, and can be accessed by any web browser. The main page of the application is a collection of article links and accompanying picture spread across the screen, colour-coded by political alignment. The number of articles presented are continuous: as the user scrolls down, more and more articles are displayed until all articles ever submitted have been shown. Users can access comments and the voting circle straight from the main screen.

The application is almost entirely community-driven. Users are enticed to the application as they can actively contribute to the discussion. Users vote, submit and comment on articles. Users can submit articles from any website, such as CNN, Huffington Post, or even an independent news blog. Instead of articles being voted up or down like Reddit, articles are voted by their political alignment. Other applications like Apple news and Flipboard are limited in that articles are chosen for the user by an algorithm, rather than by community vote. A community-driven application ensures that not one person decides what is or isn’t going to be shown on the website.

For example, a pro-brexit article might we voted by users as ‘right wing’, and the site will organise so that the user sees just as much right wing articles as they do left wing articles. That way users are sure they are seeing both sides of an argument and are not ‘filtered out’ of the opposing view. The application organises the articles not by how many votes it has, but how much discussion it brings about. This can be measured by the number of comments there are on the article. This brings discussion and debate to the forefront of the website. The application presents the same articles globally to ensure that countries with a certain world view do not take over the page, while countries with unique viewpoints are presented with the global world view. 

The application is designed for all ages and people, but it is expected that the audience be adults who read political news often. The motivation for these people to use the app are to get an understanding of how the world thinks of a particular issue, rather than what analysts in a mainstream political news network may have. 

## Team
|Name | Student Number | Course Code | Role |
--- | --- | --- | ---
Chris Wilkinson | 43942004 | BInfTech/BBusMan | Concept Definition

Meetings are scheduled at the following times:

- Monday 2pm 
- Wednesday 2pm
- Friday 1pm (when possible)

Major tasks will be assigned during the meetings with minor tasks being assigned and mentioned between the meetings. Decision making processes will occur here as well as on Slack. Since workshops are on Fridays, the necessity of a team meeting later in the afternoon will be determined in the workshop. 

In the event of poor performance and/or lack of communication, team members will make this situation aware to other members of the group such that the slacking team member is given a warning. Such an event will be documented in the Collaboration and Communication Warnings Log (see Examples below) as documentation for future purposes. Upon the 3rd proverbial strike, supervisors will be notified regarding the event with proof from the Warnings Log. 

Conflicts will be resolved through a voting process. Since there are three members in the team, there will always be a majority. If, in some case, the minority feels particularly strong about a certain situation, external opinions and insight will be acknowledged. 
## Communications
Social platforms/software to be used: 

- Google Docs and Drive for file sharing and collaboration
- Slack for communication
- Trello for task management
- Google Calendar for scheduling
- Github for version management

These platforms have been chosen out of familiarity and consequently the fluency in which the team members use the software and platforms. As a result, less time will be spent learning the interface of a certain program/platform. When a new platform is introduced to the group, there will be a priority placed on learning the interfaces and basics of the platform so that optimal use of the platform is achieved. 

The aforementioned meetings will be set in libraries around the university but for the sake of consistency and convenience, they will take place at the Social Sciences and Humanities library by default. 

Where possible, best practices will be followed for file naming conventions. This includes:

- Clear and concise file names
- Not using spaces or other characters (more specifically ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * (  ) `; : ’ ” [ ] { } , 
- Instead use camel case (“fileName”) or underscores (“file_name”)
- Proper sequential numbering. v0001, v0002, v0003, etc. will ensure that sorting is accurate. To distinguish between Drafts and final 
	- Drafts will be signified as such: v0-01, v0-02
	- Final copies: v1-01, v1-02
- Date and time stamps (when used) will follow a DDMMYY (or DDMMYYYY) and HOUR:MINUTES:SECONDS
	- fileName_12-09-16.docx
	- fileName_12-09-2016.docx
