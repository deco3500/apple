# The voting system 
## Author: Edward Liao

This is a prototype of the voting system which allows the user to view the votes only after they have voted. 

## Issues with the prototype (representation of votes)
- All votes are Left, Right or Neutral
- 50% of just any two categories
- Extreme majority of one and extreme minority of the other two
